    <h3>How to reach Hamburg</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        üöÖ by Train. <i>First</i>: don't get confused! Hamburg has three train
        stations in the inner city - Main Station, Dammtor and Altona - going
        from east to west. They are all very well connected to certain
        city-parts and most of the long distance trains (ICE and IC) pass
        through all of them. Although Main Station being the one where you can
        catch basically all major lines of the public transport system.
      </li>
      <li>
        ‚úà By Plane. Hamburg Airport (<a
          href="https://www.hamburg-airport.de/en"
          target="_blank"
          >HAM</a
        >) is directly connected to the city with the S-Bahn S1. The line spans
        from the Airport in the east to the western part of Hamburg and passes
        Main Station as well as Altona.
      </li>
      <li>
        üöó By Car. There are two highways surrounding Hamburg: the A7 builds the
        south-north connection ‚û°Ô∏è Flensburg/Kiel and Denmark, whereas the A1
        connects to the east - ‚û°Ô∏èBerlin. In principal Hamburg is quite free of
        parking fees, only in the inner city center you'll have to pay for
        parking spots. Most hotels have parking lots though.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to reach ZAL Tech Center</h3>

    ZAL Tech Center is a little well connected to Hamburg through ferry and the
    big tunnel under the Elbe. Once landed in Finkenwerder, it's a 10 minute
    walk to the Center itself (alongside the canal, it's cute).
    <ul>
      <li>
        ‚õ¥Ô∏è By ferry: We suggest Ferry 62, starting at S1, S3, U3 -
        Landungsbr√ºcken, departing in a 15-minute frequent. It's a 30-minute
        ride on the Elbe, with stops at Fischmarkt, Dockland and √ñvelg√∂nne
        (better option for those coming from the Altona station).
      </li>

      <li>
        üöå By bus: Bus 150 is starting in Altona going through the Elbtunnel.
        Caution: depending on the time, this option is not suggested due to
        frequent traffic jams. Public transport timetables are available from
        <a href="https://www.hvv.de/en">www.hvv.de/en</a>
      </li>
